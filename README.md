This project is designed to schedule tasks efficiently in a Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) environment. The program is based on an algorithm proposed in a research paper titled "Energy and performance aware-Task Scheduling in Mobile Cloud Computing environment" by Professor Xue Lin. Here's a breakdown of the key points:


•	Program Development: Developed a software program with the purpose of scheduling tasks within a Mobile Cloud Computing environment. This program is designed to automate the process of assigning tasks to available computing resources in a mobile cloud setup.

•	Proposed Algorithm: The scheduling algorithm utilized in the program is based on the one proposed in the research paper authored by Professor Xue Lin. This algorithm involves complex calculations and decision-making processes to determine the optimal allocation of tasks to various computing resources.

•	Task Prioritization and Allocation: The algorithm implemented in the program considers various factors such as task priorities, computing resource capabilities, and possibly network conditions. It aims to efficiently allocate tasks to available resources while considering performance requirements and energy consumption constraints.

•	Optimization Goals: The primary goals of the algorithm include optimizing energy consumption and execution time. This means that the program aims to minimize the amount of energy used by the computing resources while also ensuring that tasks are completed within acceptable time frames

•	Testing and Results: The program has been tested with multiple input tasks, each with different scheduling requirements. The testing likely involved running simulations or real-world experiments to evaluate the performance of the scheduling algorithm under various scenarios. The results obtained from these tests validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in achieving its optimization goals.
